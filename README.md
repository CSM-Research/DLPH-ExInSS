> **“Expert Involvement in Secondary Studies: Impacts on Protocol Definition”**

## Abstract

Secondary studies (SS) are widely used in software engineering due to their rigor and transparency. Several stages are challenging for novice researchers (e.g., protocol definition), while less problematic for experts. Although recommended, the expert involvement in SS remains underexplored.  
This paper provides an overview of how expert involvement impacts SS, especially in protocol definition. A Delphi study with 35 novices and 5 experts, after two rounds, achieved consensus. Expert participation is essential to define the protocol, especially in the most sensitive elements (e.g., search string). Novice researchers noted a gain in confidence, improvement of protocol quality, and reduction of rework, while experts noted gains in rigor, bias reduction, and reproducibility.
