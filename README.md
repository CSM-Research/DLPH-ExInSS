## Abstract

Secondary studies (SS) are widely used in software engineering due to their rigor and transparency. Several stages are challenging for novice researchers (e.g., protocol definition), while less problematic for experts. Although recommended, the effects of expert involvement in SS remain underexplored. This paper provides an overview of how expert involvement impacts SS, especially in the planning stage. A Delphi study with 35 novices and a survey with 5 experts were conducted. Expert involvement is essential to define the protocol, especially the most sensitive elements (e.g., search string). Novices and experts noted various benefits, including support for learning, enhancing research skills, and early involvement reduce rework and increases transparency.
